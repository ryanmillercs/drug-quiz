Aspirin irreversibly inhibits the platelet COX-1 enzyme to reduce formation of TxA2, thus blocking platelet aggregation
	acetaminophen	Tylenol	analgesic, nonopioid	pain, fever	reversible competitive inhibitor	cyclooxygenase-1, -2, and -3 (COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3) enzymes	oxidoreductase enzyme in platelets and SMCs (COX-1), parenchymal cells (COX-2), and the CNS (COX-3)	COX-1 and COX-2 catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), the precursor to prostanoids (prostaglandins and thromboxanes) that play key roles in inflammatory processes and pain signaling and have broad effects in tissue homeostasis.

The phosphoreceptor in turn phosphorylates a number of proteins and upregulates select gene expression. In muscle and adipose tissue, this stimulates the recruitment of hexose transport molecules (GLUT4) into the plasma membrane to increase glucose uptake from the blood. In liver cells, insulin stimulates glucose uptake and the activity of glycogen synthase, which converts glucose into glycogen for storage.	Exogenous insulins activate IR in the same way that the endogenous hormone (insulin) does, thereby stimulating the net uptake of glucose from the blood and lowering the blood glucose concentration.

By using the Na+ gradient generated by Na/K ATPase, SGLT2 co-transports glucose and Na+ from the lumen into the epithelial cells where it can then be transported back into the blood. [Based on its location (proximal tubule) and activity, SGLT2 can reabsorb 90% of glucose in the lumen's fluid to concentrate glucose in the cell against the concentration gradient.]	SGLT2-I's inhibit the SLGT2 transporter in the proximal renal tubules, thereby reducing reabsorption of filtered glucose from the tubular lumen, increasing urinary excretion of glucose, and thereby reducing the blood glucose concentration to treat the hyperglycemia that is characteristic of diabetes.
	metformin	Glucophage, Glumetza, Riomet	antidiabetic agent, biguanide 	diabetes mellitus, type 2 (T2DM)	activator	AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)	heterotrimeric kinase expressed in liver cells [and all cells]	Normally, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis that responds to changes in the ratio of [AMP] to [ATP]. When cellular energy is low, AMPK is activated and prompts a switch from ATP-utilizing anabolic pathways to ATP-producing catabolic pathways. In the liver, especially, glycolysis is stimulated while the expression of genes for enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis is repressed. The net outcome is that glucose is transported from the blood into liver cells and then catabolized to produce ATP.	Biguanides activate AMPK in liver cells to stimulate glycolytic processes that would be active under conditions of low ATP concentration and repression of the expression of genes for enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis. The net outcome is that glucose is transported from the blood into liver cells and then catabolized (to produce ATP), thereby lowering the blood glucose conentration.
