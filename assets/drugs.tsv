Aspirin irreversibly inhibits the platelet COX-1 enzyme to reduce formation of TxA2, thus blocking platelet aggregation
	acetaminophen	Tylenol	analgesic, nonopioid	pain, fever	reversible competitive inhibitor	cyclooxygenase-1, -2, and -3 (COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3) enzymes	oxidoreductase enzyme in platelets and SMCs (COX-1), parenchymal cells (COX-2), and the CNS (COX-3)	COX-1 and COX-2 catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), the precursor to prostanoids (prostaglandins and thromboxanes) that play key roles in inflammatory processes and pain signaling and have broad effects in tissue homeostasis.

The phosphoreceptor in turn phosphorylates a number of proteins and upregulates select gene expression. In muscle and adipose tissue, this stimulates the recruitment of hexose transport molecules (GLUT4) into the plasma membrane to increase glucose uptake from the blood. In liver cells, insulin stimulates glucose uptake and the activity of glycogen synthase, which converts glucose into glycogen for storage.	Exogenous insulins activate IR in the same way that the endogenous hormone (insulin) does, thereby stimulating the net uptake of glucose from the blood and lowering the blood glucose concentration.

By using the Na+ gradient generated by Na/K ATPase, SGLT2 co-transports glucose and Na+ from the lumen into the epithelial cells where it can then be transported back into the blood. [Based on its location (proximal tubule) and activity, SGLT2 can reabsorb 90% of glucose in the lumen's fluid to concentrate glucose in the cell against the concentration gradient.]	SGLT2-I's inhibit the SLGT2 transporter in the proximal renal tubules, thereby reducing reabsorption of filtered glucose from the tubular lumen, increasing urinary excretion of glucose, and thereby reducing the blood glucose concentration to treat the hyperglycemia that is characteristic of diabetes.
	metformin	Glucophage, Glumetza, Riomet	antidiabetic agent, biguanide 	diabetes mellitus, type 2 (T2DM)	activator	AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)	heterotrimeric kinase expressed in liver cells [and all cells]	Normally, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis that responds to changes in the ratio of [AMP] to [ATP]. When cellular energy is low, AMPK is activated and prompts a switch from ATP-utilizing anabolic pathways to ATP-producing catabolic pathways. In the liver, especially, glycolysis is stimulated while the expression of genes for enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis is repressed. The net outcome is that glucose is transported from the blood into liver cells and then catabolized to produce ATP.	Biguanides activate AMPK in liver cells to stimulate glycolytic processes that would be active under conditions of low ATP concentration and repression of the expression of genes for enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis. The net outcome is that glucose is transported from the blood into liver cells and then catabolized (to produce ATP), thereby lowering the blood glucose conentration.

This inhibits NPC1L1, thereby reducing the transport of dietary cholesterol to the liver and decreases total cholesterol, LDL, ApoB, and TG, while increasing HDL
	fenofibrate	Tricor	antilipemic agent, fibric acid	hypercholesterolemia	agonist	PPAR-alpha	heterodimeric nuclear receptor expressed in liver cells [and other cells]	As a nuclear receptor, PPAR-alpha is a ligand-activated transcription factor and a major regulator of lipid metabolism in the liver. Normally, its activation by endogenous ligands such as arachidonic acid and polyunsaturated fatty acids results in reuptake, utilization, and catabolism of fatty acids by upregulation of genes involved in fatty acid transport, binding, and activation, and peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation.	As an agonist, fibrates promote uptake, utilization, and catabolism of fatty acids by upregulation of genes involved in fatty acid transport, binding, and activation, and peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation. This results in decreased LDL and TG concentrations and increased HDL concentrations.
	lidocaine	Xylocaine	antiarrhythmic agent, class Ib; local anesthetic	arrhythmias [specifically: acute treatment of ventricular arrhythmias (e.g., due to myocardial infarction or during cardiac manipulation); also local and regional anesthesia]	blocker	voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels	voltage-gated ion channel (VGIC) expressed on cardiomyocytes  [Also expressed on muscle and nerve cells (i.e., those that use an action potential)]	In the depolarization phase (Phase 0) of the cardiac action potential, NaV channels change conformation from closed (C) to open (O) to allow Na+ influx into the cell, further depolarizing it to create an action potential. In cardiomyocytes, this is responsible for heart contraction. During the plateau phase (Phase 2) of the cardiac action potential, there is a slow change in NaV conformation from O to inactivated (I); completion of the shift to the inactivated conformation then allows the cell to repolarize to respond to the next stimulus. 	Class Ib AAAs bind with low affinity to resting NaV channels and prevents them from opening, thereby suppressing the flow of Na+ into the cardiomyocyte and slowing the rise of the cardiac action potential during phase 0, thereby increasing the effective threshold potential. Lidocaine binds with higher affinity to inactivated NaV channels during phase 2, effectively immobilizing the intracellular (inactivation) gate, such that NaV channels cannot recover from inactivation before the AAA unbinds. This quickens the onset of repolarization to  decrease the initiation and conduction of nerve impulses across the myocardial tissue especially in the ventricles.

Class III AAAs binds to KV channels and prevents them from opening, thereby blocking the flow of K+ out of the cardiomyocyte and slowing (prolonging) cardiomyoctye repolarization, which leads to an increase in action potential duration and an increase in the effective refractory period.

It causes changes in the expression of proteins that lead to the reabsorption of sodium and excretion of potassium, thereby increasing fluid retention, blood volume, and blood pressure.	MR antagonists prevent aldosterone from activating MR in the distal tubule, thereby suppressing increased expression of aldosterone-induced proteins (AIPs) to increase Na+ and water excretion, while conserving K+ and H+.
