	metformin	Glucophage, Glumetza, Riomet	antidiabetic agent, biguanide 	diabetes mellitus, type 2 (T2DM)	activator	AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)	heterotrimeric kinase expressed in liver cells [and all cells]	Normally, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis that responds to changes in the ratio of [AMP] to [ATP]. When cellular energy is low, AMPK is activated and prompts a switch from ATP-utilizing anabolic pathways to ATP-producing catabolic pathways. In the liver, especially, glycolysis is stimulated while the expression of genes for enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis is repressed. The net outcome is that glucose is transported from the blood into liver cells and then catabolized to produce ATP.	Biguanides activate AMPK in liver cells to stimulate glycolytic processes that would be active under conditions of low ATP concentration and repression of the expression of genes for enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis. The net outcome is that glucose is transported from the blood into liver cells and then catabolized (to produce ATP), thereby lowering the blood glucose conentration.

This inhibits NPC1L1, thereby reducing the transport of dietary cholesterol to the liver and decreases total cholesterol, LDL, ApoB, and TG, while increasing HDL
	fenofibrate	Tricor	antilipemic agent, fibric acid	hypercholesterolemia	agonist	PPAR-alpha	heterodimeric nuclear receptor expressed in liver cells [and other cells]	As a nuclear receptor, PPAR-alpha is a ligand-activated transcription factor and a major regulator of lipid metabolism in the liver. Normally, its activation by endogenous ligands such as arachidonic acid and polyunsaturated fatty acids results in reuptake, utilization, and catabolism of fatty acids by upregulation of genes involved in fatty acid transport, binding, and activation, and peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation.	As an agonist, fibrates promote uptake, utilization, and catabolism of fatty acids by upregulation of genes involved in fatty acid transport, binding, and activation, and peroxisomal and mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation. This results in decreased LDL and TG concentrations and increased HDL concentrations.
	lidocaine	Xylocaine	antiarrhythmic agent, class Ib; local anesthetic	arrhythmias [specifically: acute treatment of ventricular arrhythmias (e.g., due to myocardial infarction or during cardiac manipulation); also local and regional anesthesia]	blocker	voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels	voltage-gated ion channel (VGIC) expressed on cardiomyocytes  [Also expressed on muscle and nerve cells (i.e., those that use an action potential)]	In the depolarization phase (Phase 0) of the cardiac action potential, NaV channels change conformation from closed (C) to open (O) to allow Na+ influx into the cell, further depolarizing it to create an action potential. In cardiomyocytes, this is responsible for heart contraction. During the plateau phase (Phase 2) of the cardiac action potential, there is a slow change in NaV conformation from O to inactivated (I); completion of the shift to the inactivated conformation then allows the cell to repolarize to respond to the next stimulus. 	Class Ib AAAs bind with low affinity to resting NaV channels and prevents them from opening, thereby suppressing the flow of Na+ into the cardiomyocyte and slowing the rise of the cardiac action potential during phase 0, thereby increasing the effective threshold potential. Lidocaine binds with higher affinity to inactivated NaV channels during phase 2, effectively immobilizing the intracellular (inactivation) gate, such that NaV channels cannot recover from inactivation before the AAA unbinds. This quickens the onset of repolarization to  decrease the initiation and conduction of nerve impulses across the myocardial tissue especially in the ventricles.

	warfarin	Coumadin; Jantoven	anticoagulant, vitamin K antagonist	coagulation disorders [specifically: myocardial infarction; thromboembolic complications]	reversible competitive inhibitor	vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1)	oxidoreductase enzyme in liver	Hepatic synthesis of coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as proteins C and S, requires the presence of vitamin K. These clotting factors are biologically activated via carboxylation of the amino acid glutamic acid (Glu) to gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla), and in the process, active vitamin K is oxidatively converted to its inactive form. Vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR) restores active vitamin K.	As an competitive inhibitor of VKORC1, warfarin blocks the production of vitamin K and reduces the synthesis of active clotting factors including factors II, VII, IX, X as well as protein C and S.

Plasmin is an important serine protease that degrades many blood plasma proteins, including fibrin clots. Plasmin is released as a zymogen called plasminogen from the liver into the systemic circulation. Upon binding to clots, plasminogen adopts an open form that can be converted into active plasmin by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), and other enzymes. Activated plasmin then initiates local fibrinolysis by hydrolyzing the fibrin protein. 	By binding to fibrin in a thrombus (clot) and converting entrapped plasminogen to plasmin, thrombolytic agents initiate local fibrinolysis to dissolve blood clots associated with coagulation disorders.

During primary hemostasis, platelets must be activated to undergo aggregation and cross linking to form a hemostatic plug. The interaction of platelets with collagen fibrils exposed at the site of injury serve as a strong stimulus for platelet activation. This releases arachidonic acid from the phospholipid bilayer, which is converted to PGH2 by COX-1. PGH2 is quickly converted into TXA2, which diffuses out of the cell to serve in autocrine and paracrine signaling to recruit and stimulate neighboring platelets. TXA2 binds to platelet TP receptors that signal via Gɑq to increase the intracellular concentration of Ca2+, thereby stimulating the activation and display of GP IIb/IIIa on the platelet's surface. In turn, this serves as the platelet's fibrinogen receptor, allowing very large clumps, or aggregates, of platelets to assemble at the site of platelet activation.	Salicylate antiplatelet agents irreversibly inhibit the platelet COX-1 enzyme to reduce formation of TXA2, thus attenuating platelet activation and aggregation to reduce the risk of thrombus formation that could lead to an ACS event.

	desvenlafaxine	Pristiq	antidepressant, serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI)	MDD	reversible inhibitor [Note: because the target class is "transporter" rather than enzyme, the term "inhibitor" wouldn't normally apply to this drug class; however, because it is "Serotonin/ Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor" we use "inhhibitor" for consistency]	serotonin transporter (SERT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET)	transporters on CNS pre-synaptic neurons	Normally, SERT and NET act to take up 5HT and NE, respectively, that were secreted into the synapse. This serves to terminate the serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmission and allow for 5HT and NE catabolism or recycling.	Serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are inherently polypharmacologic. As serotonin reuptake inhibitors, they attenuate the activiy of SERT, therby reducing the reuptake of 5HT from CNS synapses. In addition, as norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, they attenuate the activiy of NET, therby reducing the reuptake of NE from CNS synapses. By increasing the synaptic availabilities of 5HT and NE, SNRIs increase serotonergic and noradrenergic transmission in the CNS to reduce symptoms of depression.
