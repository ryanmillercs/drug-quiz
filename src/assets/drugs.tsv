This is an important step in ensuring the structure and stability of the bacterial cell wall.	By binding tightly to the D-Ala-D-Ala moiety of the cell wall precursor, vancomycin sequesters the precursor from transpeptidase, thereby blocking bacterial cell wall biosynthesis by inhibiting the final transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis.
