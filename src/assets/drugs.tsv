04	aspirin	N/A	antiplatelet agent, salicylate; NSAID	secondary prevention after acute coronary syndrome (ACS)	irreversible competitive inhibitor	cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme (COX-1)	oxidoreductase enzyme in platelets	COX-1 and COX-2 catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), the precursor to prostanoids (prostaglandins and thromboxanes) that play key roles in inflammatory processes and pain signaling and have broad effects in tissue homeostasis.	Aspirin irreversibly inhibits the platelet COX-1 enzyme to reduce formation of TxA2, thus blocking platelet aggregation
	acetaminophen	Tylenol	analgesic, nonopioid	pain, fever	reversible competitive inhibitor	cyclooxygenase-1, -2, and -3 (COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3) enzymes	oxidoreductase enzyme in platelets and SMCs (COX-1), parenchymal cells (COX-2), and the CNS (COX-3)	COX-1 and COX-2 catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), the precursor to prostanoids (prostaglandins and thromboxanes) that play key roles in inflammatory processes and pain signaling and have broad effects in tissue homeostasis.	By weakly reversibly inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2, acetaminophen inhibits the biochemical conversion of arachidonic acid to PGE2. It also may inhibit COX-3 in the CNS. Polypharmacy at these receptors contributes to the analgesic and antipyretic effects of acetaminophen.

	methylprednisolone	Medrol; Depo-Medrol; Solu-Medrol	corticosteroid, systemic	inflammatory disorders [this is sufficient for MFDA; note that there are many indications that may be worth capturing from a drug information resource]	agonist	glucocorticoid receptor	steroid hormone nuclear receptor, widely expressed in a variety of cell types	Normally, cortisol binds to GR, and activation of the steroid hormone nuclear receptor modulates gene expression (via cis-activation and repression). This increases IκB-α expression, which inhibits the master inflammation regulator NFκB and prevents the activation of pro-inflammatory genes. In addition, it increases ipocortin (Annexin 1) expression to inhibit the action of phospholipase A2 and attenuate eicosanoid production.	By acting as agonists of GR, corticosteroids increase IκB-α expression, thereby inhibiting NFκB to prevent the activation of pro-inflammatory genes. The corticosteroid-GR complex also increases ipocortin (Annexin 1) expression to inhibit the action of phospholipase A2 and attenuate eicosanoid production. Together, these physiologic effects attenuate inflammatory processes such as those associated with the acute inflammatory response and auto-immune disorders.

HA binds to H1Rs on the surfaces of vascular ECs, bronchiolar SMCs, and other effector cells. Activation of H1R is signaled via Gaq to increase the intracellular Ca++ concentration. In vascular ECs, that results in cellular contraction and stimulates diffusible production of NO, which stimulates vasodilation. In bronchiolar SMCs, H1R activation results in cellular contraction and bronchoconstrction.	By acting as a reversible, orthosteric antagonist of H1R, antihistamines block activation of H1Rs, reducing bronchoconstriction, vasodilation, vessel permeability, and mucus secretion part of the allergic response

	montelukast	Singulair	leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA)	allergic rhinitis, asthma	reversible orthosteric antagonist	Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLT1R)	GPCR expressed on bronchial and secretory SMCs, and vascular endothelial cells	Normally, CysLT1 receptors are activated by cysteinyl-leukotrienes to cause contraction of SMCs to protect the airways and to increase vascular permeability as part of the acute inflammatory response.	By acting as reversible, orthosteric antagonists of cysteinyl leukotriene type 1 receptors (CysLT1R) located on bronchiolar SMCs and vascular endothelial cells, LTRAs  block CysLT1R, thereby preventing bronchoconstriction and lung tissue edema which contribute to the signs and symptoms of allergic rhinitis.
06	amoxicillin	Moxatag; Amoxil	antibiotic, beta-lactam	bacterial upper respiratory infections  [this is sufficient for MFDA; note that there are many indications that may be worth capturing from a drug information resource]	irreversible competitive inhibitor	transpeptidase [aka penicillin binding protein (PBP)]	transferase enzyme anchored to the plasma membrane of the bacteria	Transpeptidase catalyzes the cross-linking of peptidoglycan precursors in the bacterial cell wall by recognizing the D-Ala-D-Ala moiety in the precursors. This is an important step in ensuring the structure and stability of the bacterial cell wall.	By irreversibly inhibiting transpeptidase, amoxicillin blocks bacterial cell wall biosynthesis by inhibiting the final transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis. This kills or stops the growth of bacteria that can cause upper respiratory infections.

	vancomycin	Vancocin	antibiotic, glycopeptide	bacterial upper respiratory infections  [this is sufficient for MFDA; note that there are many indications that may be worth capturing from a drug information resource]	N/A [this is slightly tricky; because vancomycin binds to an enzyme substrate, not the enzyme itself, it isn't inhibiting the enzyme, but rather preventing it from being able to bind to its usual target]	D-Ala-D-Ala cell wall precursor	[no target class], found in bacterial cell wall	Transpeptidase catalyzes the cross-linking of peptidoglycan precursors in the bacterial cell wall by recognizing the D-Ala-D-Ala moiety in the precursors. This is an important step in ensuring the structure and stability of the bacterial cell wall.	By binding tightly to the D-Ala-D-Ala moiety of the cell wall precursor, vancomycin sequesters the precursor from transpeptidase, thereby blocking bacterial cell wall biosynthesis by inhibiting the final transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis. This kills or stops the growth of bacteria that can cause upper respiratory infections.

This further ultimately allows for bacterial replication.	By inhibiting DNA gyrase and Topo IV, fluoroquinolones block relaxation of coiled DNA and to help break double stranded DNA, preventing bacterial DNA replication and halting cell division

The two ribosomal subunits assemble, bind to mRNA, and catalyze new peptide bond formation between an amino acid carried by a tRNA and a growing polypeptide chain. These proteins produced are vital for bacterial cell functioning and viability	By binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit near the PTC and peptide exit tunnel, azithromycin inhibits RNA-dependent protein synthesis at the chain elongation step, resulting in blockage of transpeptidation. This prevents bacterial growth and cell division, killing or stopping the growth of bacteria that cause infections
	doxycycline	Vibramycin	antibiotic, tetracycline	bacterial upper respiratory infections  [this is sufficient for MFDA; note that there are many indications that may be worth capturing from a drug information resource]	reversible inhibitor	30S ribosomal subunit [near the P site tRNA anticodon stem loop]	[no target class], found in the cytoplasm of the bacterial cell	The ribosome is required for translation of the genetic code. The two ribosomal subunits assemble, bind to mRNA, and catalyze new peptide bond formation between an amino acid carried by a tRNA and a growing polypeptide chain. These proteins produced are vital for bacterial cell functioning and viability	By binding with the 30S ribosomal subunit near the P-site tRNA anticodon, doxycycline inhibits protein synthesis, thereby blocking bacterial growth and cell division, killing or stopping the growth of bacteria that cause infections
