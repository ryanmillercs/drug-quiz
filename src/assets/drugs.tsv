Mtg #	Drug Generic Name	Drug Brand Name	Drug Class	FDA-Approved Indications	Pharmacologic Activity	Drug Target	Target Class & Location	Target Normal Role (Physiology)	Mechanism of Action (MOA)
04	aspirin	N/A	antiplatelet agent, salicylate; NSAID	secondary prevention after acute coronary syndrome (ACS)	irreversible competitive inhibitor	cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme (COX-1)	oxidoreductase enzyme in platelets	COX-1 and COX-2 catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), the precursor to prostanoids (prostaglandins and thromboxanes) that play key roles in inflammatory processes and pain signaling and have broad effects in tissue homeostasis.	Aspirin irreversibly inhibits the platelet COX-1 enzyme to reduce formation of TxA2, thus blocking platelet aggregation
	acetaminophen	Tylenol	analgesic, nonopioid	pain, fever	reversible competitive inhibitor	cyclooxygenase-1, -2, and -3 (COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3) enzymes	oxidoreductase enzyme in platelets and SMCs (COX-1), parenchymal cells (COX-2), and the CNS (COX-3)	COX-1 and COX-2 catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), the precursor to prostanoids (prostaglandins and thromboxanes) that play key roles in inflammatory processes and pain signaling and have broad effects in tissue homeostasis.	By weakly reversibly inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2, acetaminophen inhibits the biochemical conversion of arachidonic acid to PGE2. It also may inhibit COX-3 in the CNS. Polypharmacy at these receptors contributes to the analgesic and antipyretic effects of acetaminophen.
	acetaminophen + codeine	Tylenol #3	For combination products, you'll only be responsible for brand/generic names :)						
	celecoxib	Celebrex	nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), COX-2 selective;  analgesic, nonopioid	pain also: inflammatory disorders, fever [this is sufficient for MFDA; note that there are many indications that may be worth capturing from a drug information resource]	reversible competitive inhibitor	cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme	oxidoreductase enzyme in parenchymal cells	COX-1 and COX-2 catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 (PGH2), the precursor to prostanoids (prostaglandins and thromboxanes) that play key roles in inflammatory processes and pain signaling and have broad effects in tissue homeostasis.	By reversibly inhibiting COX-2, celecoxib inhibits the biochemical conversion of arachidonic acid to PGH2 which then prevents the downstream effects of prostanoids to prevent the inflammatory response and reduce pain signalling

	methylprednisolone	Medrol; Depo-Medrol; Solu-Medrol	corticosteroid, systemic	inflammatory disorders [this is sufficient for MFDA; note that there are many indications that may be worth capturing from a drug information resource]	agonist	glucocorticoid receptor	steroid hormone nuclear receptor, widely expressed in a variety of cell types	Normally, cortisol binds to GR, and activation of the steroid hormone nuclear receptor modulates gene expression to inhibit the master inflammation regulator NFkB and prevent the activation of pro-inflammatory genes. 	Methylprednisolone acts as an agonist for the ligand activated GR, which binds to the IkB-alpha anti-inflammatory gene; IkB-alpha then inhibits NFkB. Alternatively, the drug-GR complex can directly bind to and inhibit NFkB.
